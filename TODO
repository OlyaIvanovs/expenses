What do we want?

- Know how much was spent on each category each week/month/year/arbitrary date range?
- How much money we have
    - Saved on purpose (for some category)
    - Available for use (not saved on any purpose)
- Be able to load a csv file from bank and
    - Record each transaction and guess the category (if unable to guess then be able to specify manually)
    - Add a note to each transaction if needed
- Draw some graphs:
    - Line graph for each category with the ability to choose one or more categories for comparison
    - (optional) Bar graph, where each bar is colored, displaying the percentage spent on each category that day/week/month
